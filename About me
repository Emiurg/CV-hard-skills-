Hello, everyone!

My work will not be shown here. I provided a link to GitHub in order to make it clear that I am familiar with this site, and also in order to tell a little about myself.

I worked as a doctor and it was not, what i always dreamed about.

Since my youth i loved robotics, computer sciences, arficial intelligence, graphic disign, 3D-modelling, illustrating and... writing (in russian).

As a result, i always helped medical collegues and fixed their computer defects on the job, have written some easy working algorithms on Python, modelled a lot of objects on Cinema 4D, made landing pages with HTML/CSS, created a working targeting advertising for my friends' Instagram and wrote a dozens fantastic stories, which were really loved by my readers.

At last 3 months i began to learn QA Testing, reading books and watching courses about Software Testing on different platforms, such as Udemy and learn.epam.com. As I was free, I spent 7-10 hours a day. This is almost 588 - 840 hours over this period. 

In the work of a doctor, there are many techniques that a QA Tester uses in his work. The doctor must also:

1 - Analyze the requirements of patients
2 - Build a strategy for diagnosis and treatment
3 - Calculate the risks
4 - Control the treatment process
5 - And if an operation is necessary, the doctor provides full control at the stage before the operation, during and after the operation.

I want to become good Software Testing Engineer, want to grow up with a good team, want to help them to make projects as well as nobody can.

I firmly believe that a person can bring great benefits to the whole world only when he does what he loves. We only have one life to spend on things we don't like.
